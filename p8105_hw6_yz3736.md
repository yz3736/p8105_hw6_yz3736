This is my solution to Homework 6.

## Problem 1

Create a city\_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary
variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. Omit cities Dallas,
TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t report victim race.
Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake. For this problem,
limit your analysis those for whom victim\_race is white or black. Be
sure that victim\_age is numeric.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ 0,
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ 0,
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ 1)
  ) %>% 
  filter(
    victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"),
    city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>% 
  select(city_state, resolution, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_double(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Start with one city. For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the glm function
to fit a logistic regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome
and victim age, sex and race as predictors. Obtain the estimate and
confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides
comparing non-white victims to white victims keeping all other variables
fixed.

``` r
baltimore_df =
  homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")
glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, 
    data = baltimore_df,
    family = binomial()) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(term, OR, starts_with("CI")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term              |    OR | CI\_lower | CI\_upper |
| :---------------- | ----: | --------: | --------: |
| (Intercept)       | 1.363 |     0.975 |     1.907 |
| victim\_age       | 0.993 |     0.987 |     1.000 |
| victim\_raceWhite | 2.320 |     1.648 |     3.268 |
| victim\_sexMale   | 0.426 |     0.325 |     0.558 |

Try this across cities. Extract the adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for
solving homicides comparing Black victims to white victims.

``` r
models_results_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  nest(data = -city_state) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = 
      map(.x = data, ~glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = .x, family = binomial())),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, results) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, term, OR, starts_with("CI")) 
```

Create a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city.
Organize cities according to estimated OR, and comment on the plot.

``` r
models_results_df %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = OR)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = CI_lower, ymax = CI_upper)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```
